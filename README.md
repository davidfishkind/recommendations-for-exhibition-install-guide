# Recommendations for Exhibition Installation

This guide will walk you through some of AccessKit's tried and true features, and provide direction on how to get the most out of your interactive museum and gallery experience for guests and staff alike.

## Where to Put QR Codes

QR codes are an integral part of any modern art exhibition. They supply a digital pathway to deepen viewers' relationship with artworks, artists, and exhibitions.

Each artwork set up with AccessKit will come with its own unique QR code so that visitors can easily find the accessible content. Below are some example of QR code placement and orientation to create a streamlined interaction between the art on display and its detailed web presence:

- **Included below wall text**, linking to work URL
- **Separate call-out sticker next to work**, linking to work URL
- **Floor sticker**, linking to work URL
- **QR code linking to index of all captioned works** at beginning of exhibition

We also recommend including some basic copy accompanying your AccessKit QR code, such as:
- *A frictionless and immersive synchronized video work viewing experience across a range of accessibility and language needs.*

## Information for Docents

AccessKit provides a channel to complete transcripts of video and multimedia artworks, allowing curators, critics, and guests to independently investigate the associated texts.

## Accessible Tours

AccessKit prioritizes an equity-driven experience for guests of all backgrounds and abilities.

The following features were designed to enhance and facilitate interactions between viewers, guides, and artworks:

- **Museum-wide sensory sensitivity mode** allows for easy volume adjustment for all media players in your institution or an exhibition for group tours or events. The volume for mediaplayers associated with works in your exhibition can be immediately adjusted as a proportion of their original volume setting during tours, neurodivergent hours, or social gatherings.
- **Synchronized audio descriptions** allows visually-impaired guests to experience installations in real time.
- **Toggle on/off on-screen captions** is a forthcoming feature designed to improve the ease and accessibility of captions associated with video works.

## Installation Timeline

AccessKit offers a tier of services related to setting up mediaplayers to support exhibition installs, based on subscription plan.
- This varies from up to 2 players for our **Community Edition** members
- Up to 12 for our **Institutional** services plan
- And unlimited player support for **Institutional Plus** subscribers

We recommend finalizing your AccessKit needs and orders at least 1 month in advance of your exhibition installation.

We offer off-site set up for players delivered at least 1 week before they are to be installed in the exhibition.

We ensure timely remote assistance in syncing the correct firmware and player bundles on all mediaplayers to enable media playback and captioning for video works.

## Where to Get Captions Made

Captions must be stored and uploaded as SRT files along with their associated work.

An SRT is a plain-text file that contains critical information regarding subtitles.

We are pleased to provide conversion services for text files associated with video and other multimedia works to SRT.

## How to Integrate with Existing Mobile Guides

AccessKit makes it easy to integrate our captions, transcripts, and other features with your institutional website and mobile guide apps.

The CONFIGURATION page, accessed by clicking the **Gear** icon, includes a Home Back Link URL to your website.

We also offer a custom stylesheet, along with custom icons, making it easy for your museum, gallery, or other institution to match your brand identity between your mobile guide / website and AccessKit's caption user interface.

See, for instance, The Whitney's integration of our captioning and custimization services with a link at the top of the page back to the museum's official mobile guide:
