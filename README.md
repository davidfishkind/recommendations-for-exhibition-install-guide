# Recommendations for Exhibition Installation

This guide will walk you through some of AccessKit's tried and true features, provide recommendations and tips on effective exhibition installation, and help you get the most out of your interactive museum and gallery experience, for guests and personnel alike.

## Where to Put QR Codes

QR codes are an integral part of any modern exhibition space. They supply a digital pathway linking to releveant information, and working to deepen relationships between viewers, artworks, artists, and institutions.

Each work set up with AccessKit comes with its own unique QR code so that visitors can easily find the accessible content. Below are some example of QR code placement and orientation to create a streamlined interaction between the art on display and its detailed web presence:

- **Included below wall text**, linking to work URL
- **Separate call-out sticker next to work**, linking to work URL
- **Floor sticker**, linking to work URL
- **QR code linking to index of all captioned works** at beginning of exhibition

We also recommend including some basic copy accompanying your AccessKit QR code, such as:
- *A frictionless and immersive synchronized video work viewing experience across a range of accessibility and language needs.*

## Information for Docents

AccessKit provides a channel to complete transcripts of video and multimedia artworks, allowing curators, critics, and guests to independently investigate corresponding texts.

## Accessible Tours

AccessKit prioritizes an equity-driven experience for guests of all backgrounds and abilities.

The following features were designed to enhance and facilitate interactions between viewers, guides, and artworks:

- **Museum-wide sensory sensitivity mode** allows for easy volume adjustment for all media players in your institution or exhibition. This is especially useful during group tours or events. The volume for mediaplayers associated with works in your exhibition can be immediately adjusted as a proportion of their original volume setting during tours, neurodivergent hours, or social gatherings.
   - For example: *default*: 1 (full volume); *min*: 0 (silent); *max*: 2 (double volume)
   
- **Synchronized audio descriptions** allow visually-impaired guests to experience installations in real time conveniently via their mobile device.

- **Toggle on/off on-screen captions** is a forthcoming innovation designed to improve the ease and accessibility of captions associated with video works.

## Where to Get Captions Made

AccessKit integrates clean and attractive mobile captioning for video and multimedia works, which pairs with mediaplayers to create an immersive, synchronous experience for guests.

We offer an easy content management system for multiple caption and audio tracks, with an AI-assist feature for translating captions to multiple languages.

Captions can be effortlessly synced with video via **SRT** files uploaded and stored with their corresponding artwork.

An **SRT** is a simple, plain-text file that contains critical information regarding subtitles associated with a video work.

AccessKit is also pleased to provide conversion services for text files associated with video and other multimedia works to SRT.

## Installation Timeline

AccessKit offers a tier of services related to setting up mediaplayers to support exhibition installs, based on subscription plan. This varies from:
- Up to 2 players for our **Community Edition** members
- Up to 12 for those enrolled in our **Institutional** plan
- Unlimited player support for **Institutional Plus** subscribers

We recommend finalizing your AccessKit needs and orders at least 1 month in advance of your exhibition installation.

We offer off-site set up for players delivered at least 1 week before they are to be installed in the exhibition.

We ensure timely remote assistance in syncing the correct firmware and player bundles on all mediaplayers to enable media playback and captioning for video works.

## How to Integrate with Existing Mobile Guides

AccessKit makes it easy to integrate captions, transcripts, and other features with your institutional website and mobile guide apps.

The **Configuration** page can accessed by clicking the **Gear** icon on your AccessKit admin page. It includes a **Home Back Link URL** option, which can lead viewers directly back to your institutions website, app, or mobile guide.

We also offer a custom stylesheet, along with custom icons, making it easy for your museum, gallery, or other institution to match your brand identity between your mobile guide or website with AccessKit's caption user interface.
