# Recommendations for Exhibition Install

This guide will walk you through some of AccessKit's tried and true features, and provide direction on how to get the most out of the interactive museum and gallery experience, for guests and staff alike.

## Where to Put QR Codes

QR codes are an integral part of any modern art exhibition. They supply a digital pathway to deepen viewers' relationship with artworks, artists, and exhibitions.

Each artwork set up with AccessKit will come with its own unique QR code so that visitors can easily find the accessible content. Below are some example of QR code placement and orientation to create a streamlined interaction between the art on display and its detailed web presence:

- **Included below wall text**, linking to work URL
- **Separate call-out sticker next to work**, linking to work URL
- **Floor sticker**, linking to work URL
- **QR code linking to index of all captioned works** at beginning of exhibition

We also recommend including some basic copy accompanying your AccessKit QR code, such as:
- *A frictionless and immersive synchronized video work viewing experience across a range of accessibility and language needs.*

## Information for Docents

AccessKit provides a channel to complete transcripts of video and multimedia artworks, allowing curators, critics, and guests to independently investigate the associated texts.

## Accessible Tours

AccessKit prioritizes an equity-driven experience for guests of all backgrounds and abilities.

The following features were designed to enhance and facilitate interactions between viewers, guides, and artworks:

- **Museum-wide sensory sensitivity mode** allows for easy volume adjustment for all media players in your institution or an exhibition for group tours or events. The volume for mediaplayers associated with works in your exhibition can be immediately adjusted as a proportion of their original volume setting during tours, neurodivergent hours, or social gatherings.
- **Synchronized audio descriptions** allows visually-impaired guests to experience installations in real time.
- **Toggle on/off on-screen captions** is a forthcoming feature designed to improve the ease and accessibility of captions associated with video works.
